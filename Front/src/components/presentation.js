                             With the creation of rich web pages, the development of animations and the apparition of new functionality like drag
                              and drop system to share files on websites, the development of real-time data sharing and bidirectional video flux lead
                              to the creation of a fast and almost real-time protocol.
                               Direct exchanges between navigators already existed thanks to the creation of different plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Active X.
                              Yet,these proprietary solutions werenâ€™t standardized and thus, because of the diversity, not really useful.
                              To overcome this lack of coherence Web RTC has been created by Justin Uberti and Peter Thatcher.
                              Souce code of Web RTC can be found in the following link : {"\n"}

                               a minimum of three entities: two peers and one server. The server is here to initialize
                                the connection between the two peers before they communicate with each other directly by sharing data,
                                audio and even video stream.
